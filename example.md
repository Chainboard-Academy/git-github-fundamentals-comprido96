Hello, my name is **Federico Gambassi** and I am **25** years old.
I am *sooo* excited to start this course because I want a change in my career. At the moment I work as an **IT Consultant** (Junior role), 
but I find the job ~~really boring~~ not quite challenging.
My passion for the **Blockchain** world is due to [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/garyvee) (to me, this guy's a visionary): he once said that 
> **Blockchain technology** is **_undoubtedly_** a **win-win** situation both for **artists** and **creators**.

So, @github/Chainboard-Academy , I am excited to start this bootcamp! :monkey_face::monkey_face:
